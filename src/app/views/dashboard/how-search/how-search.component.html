      <h4>Phrases:</h4>
      <p>
        Phrase Search allows you to search for documents containing an exact
        sentence or phrase rather than comparing a set of keywords in random
        order. To use phrase search use quotation marks (") around a specific
        phrase:
      </p>
      <p>
        <a
          href="https://vedabase.io/en/search/?query=%22Krsna+is+never+alone%22"
          >"Krsna is never alone"</a
        >
      </p>
      <h4>Wildcards:</h4>
      <p>
        Search supports single and multiple character wildcard searches within
        single terms (not within phrase queries).
      </p>
      <p>To perform a single character wildcard search use the "?" symbol.</p>
      <p>To perform a multiple character wildcard search use the "*" symbol.</p>
      <p>
        The single character wildcard search looks for terms that match that
        with the single character replaced. For example, to search for "text" or
        "test" you can use the search:
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://vedabase.io/en/search/?query=te%3Ft">te?t</a></p>
      <p>
        Multiple character wildcard searches looks for 0 or more characters. For
        example, to search for Hari, Harinama or HaridƒÅsa, you can use the
        search:
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://vedabase.io/en/search/?query=hari*">hari*</a></p>
      <p>You can also use the wildcard searches in the middle of a term.</p>
      <p><a href="https://vedabase.io/en/search/?query=pre*us">pre*us</a></p>
      <p>
        Note: You cannot use a * or ? symbol as the first character of a search.
      </p>
      <h4>Proximity search:</h4>
      <p>
        Vedabase search supports finding words are a within a specific distance
        away. To do a proximity search use the tilde, "~", symbol at the end of
        a Phrase. For example to search for a "paraphenalia" and "king" within 4
        words of each other in a document use the search:
      </p>
      <p>
        <a
          href="https://vedabase.io/en/search/?query=%22paraphernalia+king%22~4"
          >"paraphernalia king"~4</a
        >
      </p>
      <h4>Boolean:</h4>
      <p>
        Boolean operators allow terms to be combined through logic operators.
        Search supports AND, "+", OR, NOT as Boolean operators (Note: Boolean
        operators must be ALL CAPS).
      </p>
      <h5>OR</h5>
      <p>
        The OR operator is the default conjunction operator. This means that if
        there is no Boolean operator between two terms, the OR operator is used.
        The OR operator links two terms and finds a matching document if either
        of the terms exist in a document. This is equivalent to a union using
        sets.
      </p>
      <p>
        To search for documents that contain either "krsna" or "cow" use the
        query:
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://vedabase.io/en/search/?query=krsna+cow">krsna cow</a>
      </p>
      <p>or</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://vedabase.io/en/search/?query=krsna+OR+cow"
          >krsna OR cow</a
        >
      </p>
      <h5>AND</h5>
      <p>
        The AND operator matches documents where both terms exist anywhere in
        the text of a single document. This is equivalent to an intersection
        using sets.
      </p>
      <p>
        To search for documents that contain "practical application" and
        "control of the mind" use the query:
      </p>
      <p>
        <a
          href="https://vedabase.io/en/search/?query=%22practical+application%22+AND+%22control+of+the+mind%22"
          >"practical application" AND "control of the mind"</a
        >
      </p>
      <h5>+ (plus)</h5>
      <p>
        The "+" or required operator requires that the term after the "+" symbol
        exist somewhere in a the field of a single document.
      </p>
      <p>
        To search for documents that must contain "pure" and may contain
        "devotion" use the query:
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://vedabase.io/en/search/?query=%2Bpure+devotion"
          >+pure devotion</a
        >
      </p>
      <h5>NOT</h5>
      <p>
        The NOT operator excludes documents that contain the term after NOT.
        This is equivalent to a difference using sets. The symbol ! can be used
        in place of the word NOT.
      </p>
      <p>
        To search for documents that contain "pure devotional service" but not
        "mixed devotional service" use the query:
      </p>
      <p>
        <a
          href="https://vedabase.io/en/search/?query=%22pure+devotional+service%22+NOT+%22mixed+devotional+service%22"
          >"pure devotional service" NOT "mixed devotional service"</a
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Note: The NOT operator cannot be used with just one term. For example,
        the following search will return no results:
      </p>
      <p>NOT "mixed devotional service"</p>
      <h4>Boosting:</h4>
      <p>
        Search engine provides the relevance level of matching documents based
        on the terms found. To boost a term use the caret, "^", symbol with a
        boost factor (a number) at the end of the term you are searching. The
        higher the boost factor, the more relevant the term will be.
      </p>
      <p>
        Boosting allows you to control the relevance of a document by boosting
        its term. For example, if you are searching for
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://vedabase.io/en/search/?query=knowledge+education"
          >knowledge&nbsp;education</a
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        and you want the term "knowledge" to be more relevant boost it using the
        ^ symbol along with the boost factor next to the term. You would type:
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://vedabase.io/en/search/?query=knowledge%5E10+education"
          >knowledge^10&nbsp;education</a
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        This will make documents with the term knowledge appear more relevant.
        You can also boost Phrase Terms as in the example:
      </p>
      <p>
        <a
          href="https://vedabase.io/en/search/?query=%22pure+devotion%22%5E4+%22mixed+devotional+service%22"
          >"pure devotion"^4 "mixed devotional service"</a
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        By default, the boost factor is 1. Although the boost factor must be
        positive, it can be less than 1 (e.g. 0.2)
